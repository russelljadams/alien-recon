# [Room Name] — Writeup

> **Platform:** TryHackMe / HackTheBox / Bug Bounty
> **Difficulty:** Easy / Medium / Hard
> **Date Completed:** YYYY-MM-DD
> **Session File:** `sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-room/session.md`

## TL;DR

*One paragraph summary: what the box was, how we got in, how we escalated. The elevator pitch.*

---

## What We're Practicing

*Which bug bounty skills does this room build? Map to the skill tree.*

| Skill | Tier | What We Practiced |
|---|---|---|
| e.g. File Upload Bypass | Tier 2 | .php5 extension bypass on SweetRice CMS |
| e.g. Access Control | Tier 1 | sudo misconfiguration + writable script chain |

## The Attack — Step by Step

### Phase 1: Reconnaissance

*What's running on the target? How do we find out?*

**What we did:**
```bash
# Commands go here — copy-paste ready, with your actual IPs replaced by placeholders
```

**What we found:**

*Explain the output. What matters and what doesn't. What caught our attention and why.*

**Decision point:** *Why did we go after X service first? What was the thinking?*

---

### Phase 2: Enumeration

*Dig deeper into each interesting service.*

**What we did:**
```bash
# Commands
```

**What we found:**

*Key findings, credentials discovered, interesting endpoints, etc.*

---

### Phase 3: Exploitation — Initial Access

**The vulnerability:**
- **Name:** (CVE if applicable, or description)
- **Type:** (RCE / File Upload / SQLi / etc.)
- **Why it works:** *Explain the vulnerability conceptually. Not just "we ran the exploit" — WHY does this work? What's the developer mistake?*
- **Affected software:** Name and version
- **Required access:** What do you need to pull this off?

**The attack:**
```bash
# Exact commands, step by step
```

**What happened:**

*Walk through what each step does. If using Metasploit, what is the exploit actually doing under the hood?*

**Result:** Shell as [user] on [hostname]

---

### Phase 4: Post-Exploitation & Privilege Escalation

**Situation:** *What access do we have? What can we see? What's locked?*

**Enumeration:**
```bash
# What we ran to find privesc vectors
```

**The privesc vector:**
- **Type:** (SUID / sudo misconfig / kernel exploit / cron / etc.)
- **Why it works:** *Explain the misconfiguration or vulnerability. What should the admin have done differently?*

**The escalation:**
```bash
# Exact commands
```

**Result:** Root access

## Flags

| Flag | Value | Location |
|---|---|---|
| User | `flag_here` | /path/to/flag |
| Root | `flag_here` | /path/to/flag |

---

## Tools Used

*Every tool we touched, what it does, and why we used it over alternatives.*

| Tool | Purpose | Why This Tool |
|---|---|---|
| e.g. nmap | Port scanning + service detection | Industry standard, -sC/-sV gives us versions + default script output |
| e.g. wpscan | WordPress-specific scanner | Faster than generic scanners for WP — user enum, plugin detection, xmlrpc brute force |

---

## Bug Bounty Relevance

*How does what we practiced here translate to real-world bug hunting?*

- **Would this work on a real target?** Yes/No and why
- **Where would you find this in the wild?** (e.g. "SweetRice is rare, but arbitrary file upload via CMS admin panels is everywhere")
- **What's the bounty potential?** Severity rating, typical payout range
- **Recon pattern to remember:** How would you discover this vuln class on a bug bounty target?
